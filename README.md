## Rubbish In, Rubbish Out

The data-gathering process is one of the most crucial steps for an aspiring data analyst, which apply to my current job as a mortgage loan processor. However, the data gathering is mundane, as we are typically emailing the borrower for the same initial documents over and over again in the course of this work line. So why don't we just automate the gathering process while focusing more on analyzing the data after? 

This code exactly answers my question above and hopefully can help other processors or me out there, cutting off a lot of time while we can help more on other departments functioning more efficiently. You only need to tweak some words inside (such as the name of the borrower or maybe documents required for your company).
